# PW GEN ZAO
This week's weekly challenge was to make a password generator that you can specify with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols.
i have changed and added to this code in the following ways (and more)
1. added prompts for password criteria 
2. added a function to create a random password (catered to the users choices)
3. added math.random equations to calculate random numbers and misc (symbols and letters)
4. validated the users input and made their choices correspond to what they choose
5. added quality comments to show my thought process as i worked through things
6. added 5 div's in HTML (checkboxes) to make the site more friendly to generating a password more than once 

the repository for this assignment is: https://github.com/LukeMcHenry311/pw-gen-zao
the URL of the deployed application is: https://lukemchenry311.github.io/pw-gen-zao/ - ?debug at the end of the URL if your browser doesnt load works for me
